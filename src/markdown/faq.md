## Offers and Requests

<a id="sharing-guidelines"></a>

### What are the guidelines for posting offers and requests?

- You may only use Kindista for non-profit sharing. 
  Selling, renting, trading, and bartering are expressly forbidden.
  **Therefore, you may not post an offer as part of a request or a request as part of an offer.**
  More information about this policy is available [here](#can-i-barter-on-kindista).
- Posting an offer or a request does not create a specific obligation to give. 
  It is your responsibility to use normal judgment, precautions and comfort levels in choosing to 
  give or accept any appropriate offerings with other participants of Kindista.
- You are permitted to include the conditions under which you might accept an offer or a request,
  including charging a gift recipient for any out-of-pocket expenses associated with your gift.
- Members are not expected to guarantee or provide warranties for the goods or services they 
  share through Kindista.
- Honesty and communication are foundational to healthy community function. 
  Therefore, you must accurately communicate your abilities and qualifications for the  services
  you offer, as well as the qualities and condition of any goods you offer.
- Before committing to share goods or services, verify that you and the recipient are in agreement
  about what exactly will be shared.
- Although it is your right to decline an interaction at any time, you understand that the
  strength and integrity of our community depends on our ability to rely on each other and to 
  follow through with our commitments.
- If you are unable or unwilling to follow through with a commitment you have already
  made with another member, it is your responsibility to communicate to that member as soon as
  possible the reasons for which you are breaking your commitment.
- After someone on Kindista has shared goods or services with you, you are generally expected to
  post a [Statement of Gratitude](/gratitude/new) about them unless they have requested otherwise.
  Your statement of gratitude will encourage others to share with those who have shared with you.
- In accordance with the [Terms of Use](/terms), neither Kindista 
  nor its parent organization CommonGoods Network holds responsibility for any liability or 
  damages that may occur during any exchanges and you release us from such liability.

These Guidelines are not suggestions. They are the rules, principles, and expectations to which
you **MUST** agree if you use Kindista to share resources.
Please refer to the [Terms of Use](/terms) for more information regarding these Guidelines and 
your responsibilities in using Kindista.

<a id="what-can-i-offer-and-request"></a>

### What kinds of things can be offered and requested on Kindista?

Request anything that might improve your quality of life
or that you would otherwise have to pay money for.
Offer anything you think might be useful
or appreciated by someone else.
Offers and requests can include food, clothing,
tools, materials, tutoring or instruction,
skills, support, housing, work space, or art.
You can even offer the temporary use of tools,
equipment, or living or work space.
Get creative.  We encourage you to post anything you have
that is underutilized, or of which you have excess.

<small><a href="#questions">Return to questions</a></small>

<a id="am-i-obligated-to-give-an-offer"></a>

### Do I have to give an offer I've posted to anyone who asks for it?

No. We encourage you to be discerning
in deciding when you will give an offer or fulfill a request.
When giving is pure, it feels good to both the recipient
and the giver.
There is no right or wrong answer on this.
Each of us has slightly different criteria we may use
when making this decision.
Here are some things you may want to consider
when deciding whether to respond to a request:

- Do I genuinely care about this person?
- Do I have a positive emotion about helping this person?
- [Can I trust](#can-i-trust-someone-on-kindista) this person?
- Is this a gift that I really want to give?
- Are there specific circumstances under which I feel comfortable
  giving this gift?
  And if so, will those circumstances be met in this situation?
- Do I think this gift will really be beneficial to this person?
- If I am only able to give this gift to one person,
  is this person the person I really want to give this gift to?
- Given what I know about this person,
  do I think they are contributing significantly
  to others in their community to the best of their abilities?
- If I don't think they are giving in turn,
  will my gift support them to become more generous,
  or will will it encourage "free-loading"?

All that we ask is that you make every reasonable effort
to follow through with your offer once you agree to give
to someone.

<small><a href="#questions">Return to questions</a></small>

<a id="sharing-privacy"></a>

### Can I limit who can see the offers and requests I post?

To limit who can see your offers and requests, 
you must first join one or more [groups](#joining-groups). 
After your membership to a group has been approved by one of the group's 
administrators, you will be able to limit who can see an offer or 
request. 
To do so, edit the offer or request and select from your available 
groups under "**Who can see this offer/request?**".

<small><a href="#questions">Return to questions</a></small>

<a id="can-i-request-things-i-can-afford-to-buy"></a>

### Should I request things that I can afford to buy myself?

Yes! We're building a culture where we want to share with each other
because we actually care about each other, not just because
we receive pieces of paper with numbers on them in return.
Even if you are blessed with financial abundance, 
we hope you will still try to get as many of your needs
met through gift as possible.
If you find that you are able to get some of your needs met through gift,
we hope that you will share your financial abundance with others
so that they can pay for needs that are hard to meet directly through sharing,
such as utilities, car insurance, and phone bills.

<small><a href="#questions">Return to questions</a></small>

<a id="can-i-barter-on-kindista"></a>

### Can I use Kindista to barter with other members?

Kindista is specifically designed to encourage a culture of sharing
in which we are all able to give freely without having to worry
about how we are going to get our needs met in return.
In that spirit, it is a violation of the [Terms of Use](/terms)
to post an offer that requires the recipient to give you
goods or services in return.
Similarly, it is a violation to post a request in which you offer
to barter goods or services in return.
However, it is perfectly acceptable to charge the recipient
pass-through costs (materials, fuel, etc.) or require them
to provide materials that will be used in creating a gift
(such as yarn for knitted clothing or wood and nails for a deck).

<small><a href="#questions">Return to questions</a></small>

<a id="are-resources-taxable"></a>

### Are resources shared using Kindista taxable?

Most gifts are not taxable in the United States.
Please refer to the IRS guidelines regarding gift taxes 
[here](http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Frequently-Asked-Questions-on-Gift-Taxes)
and
[here](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Eight-Tips-to-Determine-if-Your-Gift-is-Taxable).
If you are still unsure about whether your gift is taxable
you may want to consult a tax attorney.

<a id="how-do-i-add-pictures"></a>

### How do I include pictures with my offers, requests, and gratitude?

First post the text for your item. After you post it, there will be a link to add pictures.

## People

<a id="can-i-trust-someone-on-kindista"></a>

### How do I know I can trust someone on Kindista?

Kindista offers a variety of ways to determine whether other people 
on the site are trustworthy. 
When looking at someone's profile, you can see if you have any 
[mutual connections](#what-are-mutual-connections).
If you see anyone on their mutual connections list 
whom you feel that you can trust, 
you can contact the connection for a referral. 
If you don't see any dependable mutual connections, 
take a look at their 
[reputation](#what-is-gratitude).

We encourage you to expand your comfort zone for generosity. 
But at the same time, we want you to feel safe. 
Always check in with your gut and your heart when 
considering meeting up with someone you don't already know
in the real world.

<small><a href="#questions">Return to questions</a></small>
<a id="what-are-contacts"></a>

### What are contacts?

Contacts are like people you follow on Twitter or Google+.
When you add someone to your contacts, 
their public activity (offers, requests, events, and announcements) 
will show up in your activity feed,
and they will get a notification that you have added them.
If they choose to add you back, 
they will show up in 
[mutual connections](#what-are-mutual-connections) 
on your profile page 
and you will be able to see any content that they 
are sharing exclusively with their contacts.
Adding someone as a contact also makes it easier to send them messages
and find them in the search bar.
You can see all of your contacts [here](/people/contacts).

<small><a href="#questions">Return to questions</a></small>
<a id="what-are-mutual-connections"></a>

### What are mutual connections on a person's profile?

Mutual connections are contacts of yours 
who have also listed the person whose profile you are looking at 
as one of their own contacts as well. 
Mutual connections can help you determine 
if you might want to share with someone. 
If you have any uncertainty about interacting with someone on Kindista 
please contact a mutual connection first and ask them if they think 
the person in question would be trustworthy for your particular situation.

*Note: when you see one of your contacts listed as a mutual connection, 
that does not necessarily mean that the person whose profile you are looking at 
has also added the person to their own contacts list.*

<small><a href="#questions">Return to questions</a></small>
<a id="how-do-invitations-work"></a>

### How do invitations work?

Kindista membership is primarily by invitation.
This means that it is up to **you** to help our network grow.
We encourage you to send invitations wisely, inviting people you trust 
who will actively share their resources with, and ask for support from,
the Kindista community.

Our invitation system creates a trail of accountability 
and helps us prevent spam and abuse as we grow.
This system allows us to remove invitation privileges 
from people who abuse our community or who invite abusers to join.

By default we will add your invitees to your contacts list (and
you to their list) when they join. You can add or remove 
someone from your contacts at any time by visiting their profile page.

<small><a href="#questions">Return to questions</a></small>
<a id="flagging-other-users"></a>

### How do I post a concern or complaint about another user on Kindista?

Please [contact us](/contact-us) immediately if you have been mistreated 
by another Kindista member or if you have a verifiable reason to believe 
that a Kindista member poses a threat to your safety, your property, or the 
safety or property of other Kindista members.

Please do not contact us for simple disagreements or misunderstandings 
with other members.
In any case 
_please do not air your grievances by misusing Kindista's functionality_ 
(such as misusing the "Gratitude" functionality as a 
method to publicly post your concerns).  Such misuse of Kindista's 
functionality is a violation of Kindista's [Terms of Use](/terms) and will 
not be tolerated.

We take your concerns very seriously and we handle them on a case-by-case 
basis. 
However we make no guarantees about what actions (if any) we might take 
in your specific circumstances. 
Please remember that Kindista has no liability whatsoever for your 
interactions with other Kindista members (for more about this 
please refer to our [Terms of Use](/terms)).
Please use [good judgement](#can-i-trust-someone-on-kindista) when choosing 
who to give to or receive from.


## Groups

<a id="what-are-groups"></a>

### What are groups?

Groups are Kindista accounts for local organizations. 
You can create a group profile for any business, non-profit, 
faith community, or organization in which you have a leadership 
or administrative role. 
_We want to prevent confusion to other Kindista users by preventing 
the creation of duplicate group accouts.
Please make sure that someone hasn't already created a group 
profile for your group, before creating a new group account._

<small><a href="#questions">Return to questions</a></small>

<a id="joining-groups"></a>

### How do I join a group?

It is up to a group's administrator(s) to determine how members can join 
a group. 
If the administrators have allowed people to request membership, 
there will be a button on the group's profile page that says "**Join
group**".
If that button is not on the group's profile page, membership for the 
group is _by invitation only_.

<small><a href="#questions">Return to questions</a></small>

<a id="multiple-group-locations"></a>

### Can I add multiple locations for our group?

For technical reasons, groups are not able to have multiple locations at this time.
However, if your group has multiple locations, you are permitted to create separate group profiles for each location.


<small><a href="#questions">Return to questions</a></small>

## Expressing Gratitude

<a id="what-is-gratitude"></a>

### What is a statement of gratitude?

Posting gratitude is a way of showing your appreciation 
for other people on Kindista.
This appreciation helps people feel more excited about 
sharing and helps us build a culture of generosity. 
Expressing gratitude also let other people know that 
the person you have written about is contributing to the network. 
This helps us build trust in the knowledge that 
eventually our generosity will come back to us; 
that we're not supporting a culture of 
free-loading.

We encourage you to express gratitude for anyone 
that has shared something meaningful with you, 
even if it's small.
You can also thank multiple people in the same statement of gratitude 
when you receive benefit from their collective efforts at the same time. 

You can edit or amend your statements of gratitude about other people about 
other people any time. 
This way, if someone shares additional resources with you in the future 
you can edit what you have written and your edited statement
will re-appear near the top of the activity feed 
for your community to see.

<small><a href="#questions">Return to questions</a></small>
<a id="can-i-post-gratitude-about-anyone"></a>

### Can I post gratitude about someone if I haven't received any resources from them?

Yes! We encourage you to express gratitude
about anyone who you have witnessed making 
significant contributions to your community as a whole, 
or to the world at large, 
even if you personally didn't benefit. 
Many important contributions don't have any primary recipients. 

Examples include:
- turning an abandoned parking lot into a public park;
- mediation work to stop gang violence;
- sitting in old-growth trees to keep them from being cut down;
- community, or regional infrastructure projects;
- cleaning up litter.

All that we ask is that you limit your expressions of gratitude, 
to information of which you have first-hand knowledge, 
or are otherwise certain of its accuracy. 
In addition to violating the 
[terms of use](/terms), 
posting inaccurate information in a statement of gratitude 
can reflect poorly on your own Kindista reputation, 
and may cause people to lose trust in you.

<small><a href="#questions">Return to questions</a></small>
<a id="why-express-gratitude-publicly"></a>

### Why should I express my gratitude publicly?

A public reputation of generosity can act as a currency,
similar to money, in that it facilitates more frequent exchanges 
of resources. 
When we share our gratitude publicly 
it helps us build a larger culture of generosity and appreciation. 

Our goal is to enable active members of the sharing economy 
to get a substantial portion of their needs met through resource sharing.
In order for that to happen we need to bring 
lots and lots of new people into the network. 
Many of these new folks will only start to participate 
if they see that other people are already getting 
lots of their needs met through the system. 
That's why it's up to us to be 
as publicly generous and appreciative as possible right now.
